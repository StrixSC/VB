# Version Blocklets

### More blocklets!
#### This time for coders! 


### What? 

Blocklets to show the version of your programming languages or technologies!

### Why? 

Because I like i3-blocks and it's handy to have versions or information regarding those technologies on demand. 


Also has very little dependencies.
