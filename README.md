# Version Blocklets

### More blocklets ---
#### This time for coders! 

### What? 

Blocklets to show the version of your programming languages or technologies!

### Why? 

Because I like i3-blocks and it's handy to have versions or information regarding those technologies on demand. 


Also has very little dependencies. Each language/tech will have only its respective dependency. I.e.: obviously to know python's version, you will need python.


## Example:
