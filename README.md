# Version Blocklets

### More blocklets
##### This time for coders!

### What?

Blocklets to show the version of your programming languages or technologies!

### Why?

Because I like i3-blocks and it's handy to have versions or information regarding those technologies displayed on screen sometimes.

Also has very little dependencies. Each language/tech will have only its respective dependency. I.E.: obviously to know python's version, you will need python.

Blocklets only depend on:
  - awk
  - cut
  - sed
  - Technology's interpreter, compiler or cli

### Installation

Clone the repo and adjust the PATH inside of your i3blocks config to the installation path.
See the example.conf for more information.

## Todo:
